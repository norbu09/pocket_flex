# PocketFlex Roadmap

This document outlines the planned next steps and future enhancements for the PocketFlex framework.

## Recently Completed

- ✅ Simplified state storage system using a single ETS table
- ✅ Removed unnecessary GenServer and DynamicSupervisor components
- ✅ Maintained compatibility with existing flow and node implementations
- ✅ Optimized resource usage and code maintainability
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with idiomatic Elixir error tuple patterns
- ✅ Improved async flow implementation with better error handling
- ✅ Fixed code quality issues and improved code organization

## Next Steps

### 1. Documentation Updates

- ✅ Update the documentation to reflect the new state storage approach
- ✅ Add examples showing how to use the shared state storage
- ✅ Document the simplified flow execution model
- ✅ Improve inline documentation with more detailed @doc and @moduledoc

### 2. Error Handling Improvements

- ✅ Add more robust error handling in the async flows
- [ ] Implement better recovery mechanisms for failed nodes
- [ ] Add monitoring capabilities to track flow execution
- [ ] Create standardized error reporting and logging

### 3. Testing Enhancements

- [ ] Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases
- [ ] Create property-based tests for the state storage system
- [ ] Add stress tests for concurrent access to the shared state
- [ ] Implement integration tests for complex flows

### 4. Additional Features

- [ ] Implement a distributed state storage backend (using :pg or Phoenix PubSub)
- [ ] Add support for flow visualization (generate diagrams of flows)
- [ ] Create a telemetry integration for monitoring flow execution
- [ ] Add support for conditional flow execution

### 5. Code Cleanup

- ✅ Run `mix credo` and address any code quality issues
- ✅ Run `mix dialyzer` to catch any type-related issues
- ✅ Ensure consistent coding style throughout the codebase
- ✅ Refactor any remaining complex functions

### 6. Additional State Storage Backends

- [ ] Add a PostgreSQL-based state storage for persistence
- [ ] Develop a pluggable backend system for custom storage solutions

### 7. Flow Management Enhancements

- [ ] Add support for flow versioning
- [ ] Implement flow migration capabilities
- [ ] Add flow composition (flows that can include other flows)
- [ ] Create a flow registry for reusable flow patterns

### 8. Node Library Expansion

- [ ] Create more specialized nodes for common operations
- [ ] Implement adapters for popular Elixir libraries
- [ ] Add support for external service integration (HTTP, databases, etc.)
- [ ] Develop a node generator for quickly creating custom nodes

### 9. Deployment and Release Management

- [ ] Ensure proper release configuration

## Prioritization

The suggested order of implementation:

1. ✅ Documentation Updates (High Priority) - Completed
2. ✅ Code Cleanup (High Priority) - Completed
3. Error Handling Improvements (High Priority) - Partially completed, next focus
4. Testing Enhancements (Medium Priority)
5. Additional Features (Medium Priority)
6. Flow Management Enhancements (Medium Priority)
7. Node Library Expansion (Medium Priority)
8. Additional State Storage Backends (Low Priority)
9. Deployment and Release Management (Low Priority)
